requirements:
PyQt4, OpenGL, numpy, scipy

to run, 
python poly.py

to change the number of vertices and/or iterations 
in ln 120 of poly.py change x in
mainwindow.mCarlo(x,n) #n corresponds to the number of runs.


To Do:
1) correct the algorithm, to always ensure it reaches the global maximum
2) algorithm to draw edges and hence faces
